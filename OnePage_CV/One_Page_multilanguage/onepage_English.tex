\aboutme{

\noindent I am a data scientist specialising in Biodiversity and Public Health, with over a decade of experience conducting and publishing innovative research. My expertise lies in analysing large, complex datasets and leveraging advanced data-science approaches to uncover global patterns in public health coverage and the intricate relationships between biodiversity, environmental factors, and human impact. I have a strong background in data analysis, GIS, and statistical modelling, with extensive proficiency in R programming, enabling me to deliver impactful insights that inform decision-making in public health and life sciences.
