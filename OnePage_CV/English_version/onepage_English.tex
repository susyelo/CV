\aboutme{

\noindent I am a researcher and data scientist specialising in policy oriented research projects in public health and biodiversity. I have successfully contributed to international organisation and research teams combining expertise in data science in the areas of public health, epidemiology, ecology and evolution. My expertise lies in analysing large, complex datasets and leveraging statistical approaches and spatial analysis to uncover global patterns in public health coverage and the intricate relationships between biodiversity, environment, and human impact.
